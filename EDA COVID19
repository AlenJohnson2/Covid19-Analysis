--The dataset for this project has been acquired from [this link](www.ourworldindata.org) 

--Firstly, I imported the dataset into excel and I split up the dataset into two - covid_deaths,covid_vaccinations

--Finding death % and % of population infected  
select location,date,total_cases,total_deaths,new_cases,population,(total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as deathpercent ,
(total_cases/population)*100 as percentpopulationinfected
from `portfolio-380906.COVID.covid_deaths`
--where location="India"
order by location ,date desc


-- Looking at countries with highest(max) population infected rate compared to population
select location,population,max(total_cases) as highestinfection ,max((total_cases/population))*100 as percentpopulationinfected
from `portfolio-380906.COVID.covid_deaths`
group by location,population
order by percentpopulationinfected desc

--Finding highest death count per population(countries)
select location,max(total_cases)as Totalcases,max(total_deaths)as Totaldeaths
from `portfolio-380906.COVID.covid_deaths`
where continent is not null
group by location
order by Totaldeaths desc

-- Finding continent wise
select continent,max(total_deaths)as Totaldeaths
from `portfolio-380906.COVID.covid_deaths`
where continent is not null
group by continent
order by Totaldeaths desc

--Find global death percentage
select date,sum(new_cases)as Totalcases,sum(new_deaths) as Totaldeaths ,nullif(sum(new_deaths),0)/nullif(sum(new_cases),0)*100 as Deathpercentage
from `portfolio-380906.COVID.covid_deaths`
where continent is not null
group by date
order by date desc
